#  Accident Detection with a Reporting System 

## üìã Overview
The rising global population and improved economic conditions have led to a significant increase in vehicle numbers worldwide. As a result, road accidents have become a critical issue, requiring prompt and accurate intervention to save lives. This project aims to leverage a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model using **Deep Learning** to detect accidents in real time and send immediate alerts to emergency services.

By accurately identifying accident scenes, this system could reduce response time, allowing emergency teams to reach the site faster, ultimately saving lives.

## üìù Abstract
Emergency services can save lives by receiving accurate accident site data and responding quickly. Using Deep Learning with CNNs in Python, this project provides a real-time accident detection and reporting solution. By deploying this solution in real-life scenarios, authorities and emergency responders can reduce fatalities caused by road accidents.

## üöÄ Setup and Execution Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the Accident Detection and Reporting System:

1. **Download Project Files**:
   - Download the project files and extract them to `C:\Users\Admin`.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open **Anaconda Navigator** and launch **Jupyter Notebook**.
   - Navigate to the extracted project folder in Jupyter.

3. **Configure Twilio**:
   - Sign up or log in to your Twilio account.
   - Obtain a virtual phone number, **Account SID**, and **Auth Token** from your Twilio dashboard.

4. **Update Configuration in Code**:
   - Open the `Accident Detection-Video.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Enter your Twilio **Account SID**, **Auth Token**, and virtual phone number in the appropriate fields within the code.
   - Specify the phone number where the alert SMS should be sent.

5. **Run the Code**:
   - Execute each cell in the notebook to start the accident detection system.
   - The system will detect accidents in video feeds and send alerts to the specified phone number if an accident is identified.

## üìö Technical Details

- **Technology Stack**: Python, Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Twilio API.
- **Libraries Used**: 
  - `TensorFlow` for building and deploying the CNN model.
  - `OpenCV` for video processing and accident detection.
  - `Twilio API` for sending SMS alerts.
  
The system processes video feeds to identify accidents and, upon detection, uses Twilio‚Äôs API to send an immediate SMS notification to emergency contacts.
